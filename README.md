# School-Bus-Monitoring-and-Management-System

# 1. Introduction:
There are buses made available for Students monitoring distances, but not many parents have complete information about these buses. Complete information namely the number of buses that go to the required destination, bus numbers, bus timings, the routes through which the bus would pass, time taken for the bus to reach, maps that would guide the parents with his/her son/daughter route and most importantly, track the current location of the bus and give the correct time for the bus to reach its bus stop. The proposed system deals with overcoming the problems stated above. The system is an Android application that gives necessary information about all the buses monitoring in Pune. This information overcomes the problems faced in the previously built application “Pune Bus Guide”. The platform chosen for this kind of system is android, reason being Android Operating System has come up on a very large scale and is owned by almost every second person. Also, Android is a user-friendly platform, thereby enabling ease of access for all the users. A number of applications made for the Android Operating System is increasing on a large scale ever since its advent. Android is an open source mobile software environment. Brought up by Google, the operating system has been made Linux based and uses Java programming language. It has a virtual machine that is used to optimize memory usage as well as resources. This application has been developed using IDE (Android Studio 1.6) with ADT (Android Development Tools) and Android SDK (Software Development Kit). There are a number of constraints that need to be satisfied.

# 1.1 Purpose:
The main goal of the proposed work is to improve the School Bus Monitoring and Management System by adding the necessary additional features into the application, like accurate bus timings, correct bus numbers and moreover adding a GPS tracker into it. This study accepts input in the form of selection of the source and destination and selection of the bus travelling the distance to display the entire details about the routes and also track the location of the respective bus and give the map for the same. The last two decades have seen growing interest in the development of Android based platform.

# 1.2 Scope:
Many city bus systems have discovered that GPS tracking system which allows to monitor the location and arrival time of their bus actually increase the number of people using city buses for routine communing. The application is a user friendly one that anyone can access for free of cost. The basic idea for this project was to guide the bus travelers with the routes, all the possible stops that come on their way to the destination and moreover, display maps and track their locations and show the estimate remaining time required to reach. The aim is to overcome all the drawbacks faced in all the previous applications and generate fast and accurate results. The proposed system has been divided into two modules as follows. Module 1 gives information about all the routes from the source to the destination and give maps for the same. Module 2 give information about all the buses along with the bus numbers that go through the selected stops, track the location of the selected bus and send this information to the passenger giving him/her the estimate time required for the bus to reach.

-	Parent: fathers and mothers of the students.
-	Bus driver: a people who works for a bus company, They drive the bus to take the students from there house to school and from the school to the house.
